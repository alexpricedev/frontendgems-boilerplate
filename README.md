## Installation

Clone this repository:

`git clone https://github.com/alexpriceonline/frontendgems-boilerplate.git`

## Run

Get the npm packages:

`npm install`

Run the gulp build process:

`gulp`

Serve the files, I use a Python simple HTTP server:

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## Code standard

FrontendGems are design to be the pinnacle of front-end development
programming. This boilerplate (_as closely as possible_) follows the
[Trello CSS guide](https://gist.github.com/bobbygrace/9e961e8982f42eb91b80).

It also tries to keep all CSS attributes in alphabetical order with mixins
and `@extend`s at the top of the block. _NB. Responsive mixins should go at
the bottom of the CSS block_.
